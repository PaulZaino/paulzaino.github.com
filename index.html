						<p>This was an extensive group project that was conducted over the course of my entire Spring 2010 quarter in COGS 102C with Prof. Hollan. The project was an investigation of the dialectic relationship between professors and their students. </p>

						<p>As a group we collected data by setting in on many professors of with a diverse range of lecture styles. We then conducted a contextual interview with the professors with the knowledge we had gained by observing them. After all of our data gathering was completed we organized it using affinity notes and an affinity diagram. This was a long an painstaking process but we gained a lot from it.</p>

						<p>We then used our infinity diagram to inform us of ways we might redesign the tools lecturers use or the lecture environment as a whole in a way that allows professors to teach more effectively. One of the ideas we presented we introduce a system in which professors could annotate and manipulate lecture slides utilizing a touch screen that projected the image of the professors activity. Video and audio of the lecture could also be captured and utilized by students for studying the material. This idea was the basis of James McCloskey's "Simulcast Lectures" project which is still being worked on to this day. For more information about the current status of this project please visit the <a href="http://www01.simulcastlectures.com/">Simulcast Lectures Website</a></p>

						<p>Other ideas that were presented were a more advanced laser pointer that allowed professors to manipulate media as well as highlight information and a live in class forum that allowed professors, TA's and students with a more efficient way of communicating in the classroom.</p>

						<p>We came up with a plethora of design ideas through brainstorming and visioning sessions. The image the left is an example of some of the designs in the early stages of their development. I learned a great deal from this course both in the way of working effectively in a group as well as the proper way to use the methods of contextual design.</p>

								<p>This was a group project that I completed in a Human Computer Interaction course with Prof. Hollan. Each member of the group conducted field observations of the way drivers incorporate listening to music into their driving experience.</p>

								<p>The purpose of collecting this data was to gain information about ways we could redesign the user interface between drivers and their music. One of the more intuitive redesign suggestions we came up with was utilizing the abundance of information that can be collected on cell phones (GPS info, current weather conditions, etc) and using this information to create meta-data for what circumstances people tend to listen to certain music. That meta-data could then be used to automatically provide the user with music to listen to, to complement his/her current state based on that meta-data.</p>

			<h3>Cash Register Redesign</h3><br/>

		<div class="span6">
			<p>For my COGS 120 course with Prof. Hollan I was assigned to create a product redesign proposal. The product I decided to examine was a cash register that I use at my place of work. Some of the issues I brought up in my proposal were issues of organization of the different buttons as well as improper display of the devices current state through the use of it's digital display. There were also several errors regarding error prevention and ease of diagnosing errors.</p>

			<p>I found that the interface of the cash register was ineffective in facilitating many important tasks within the cognitive ecology of the coffee cart. After examining the origination of the device it became apparent that even very small modifications to the interface would make it considerably more useable. For example the addition of borders to divide significant groupings of items would make the interface much easier to navigate. Also a larger display, or at least a more dynamic display, would make detecting and diagnosing errors much more effective</p>

						<h3> About Me </h3><br/>
						<p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my portfolio. My name is Paul and I recently graduated from UCSD with a BS in Cognitive Science specializing in Human Computer Interaction. I graduated Cum Laude and the curriculum I studied focused on learning how people think, learn, and communicate. The HCI component of my studies introduced me to how I could integrate this knowledge along with user centered design methods to create seamless interaction between humans and computers. This multidisciplinary background gives me an advantage over the pure graphic designer because I have studied information architecture, process flows, site mapping, and how to create wireframes.</p>
